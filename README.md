# Deep parameters research
This application implements the ability to conduct research to find the relationship between the deep statistical parameters and the values of reliability coefficients.

## Load data
The first step is to load the data from the excel or csv file into the application.

## Calculation of reliability by vibration signal
The second step is to calculate the reliability, based on vibration signal. Reliability coefficients are assigned to each value of the vibration signal.

## Setting parameters for the study
The third step is to set the parameters to investigate the relationship between the underlying statistical parameters and the reliability coefficient. At this step you can select the maximum depth to calculate, the value of the shift, set the interval for calculating the characteristics for each level and select the investigated statistical characteristics.

## Result output
In the fourth step, for each selected statistical parameter the correlation coefficient with the reliability value is calculated and displayed.
The correlation coefficients can be sorted or filtered by some value.
