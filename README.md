# Deep parameters research
This application implements the ability to conduct research to find the relationship between the deep statistical parameters and the values of reliability coefficients.

## Load data
The first step is to load the data from the excel or csv file into the application.

## Calculation of reliability by vibration signal
The second step is to calculate the reliability, based on vibration signal. Reliability coefficients are assigned to each value of the vibration signal.

## Setting parameters for the study
The third step is the setting of parameters to investigate the relationship between the underlying statistical parameters and the reliability coefficient. At this step it is possible to select the maximum depth for the calculation, to set the interval for calculating the characteristics for each level and to select the investigated statistical characteristics.
